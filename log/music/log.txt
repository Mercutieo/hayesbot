Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/4/2017 19:6:47: how do you guys find new music?
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:53:21: <@!189597563295367171> Given my inclinations to Metal, I use Metal Archives "Similar Artists" tab on pages of bands I like. Most of the other artists I listen(not metal) to either come from word of mouth or recommendations on YouTube
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:53:59: Metal Archives is full of a bunch of hipster elitists anyway, so don't use it to read the reviews
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:54:37: RateYourMusic is also a very good site to use if you want to find new stuff, but it's a lot different.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:55:17: I'd suggest going to an artist you like and looking at some lists that they're featured in(you might find someone new that way).
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:56:32: Sorry if I went on too long, but I think this should help out most people looking for new music
Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/4/2017 19:57:49: have you seen the "whats in my bag" series on youtube
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:57:57: no
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:58:0: I haven't
Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/4/2017 19:58:28: it's pretty cool, a bunch of artists just talking about what they buy at a record store
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:58:42: that does sound pretty interesting
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:58:56: My local record store is pretty cool
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 19:59:27: I'm usually able to find something good everytime I go(every 2 weeks)
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:1:1: I've been building a CD collection, most of it is older rock & metal. I'm planning on buying all the essentials(for me) in those genres then moving to the other genres I'm interested in.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:36:6: oh man this video
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:36:17: also, Gorillaz is good
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:45:40: <@!153620030767104000> there new album is full of great rappers ans singers my cusion showed me them so i brought it
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:46:16: I like Gorillaz, but their recent album was kind of a disappointment
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:47:1: I guess that means you'll find their earlier stuff even better if you like this one
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:48:16: props not i was told rappers and singers with animated band so i was like k ill try
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:48:42: why wouldn't you like their older stuff if you like the newer album?
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:48:55: It's roughly the same style but done a lot better
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:49:39: "better" your opinon but i like this cuz it has so much features with good rappers
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:49:57: have you even listened to their earlier stuff?
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:4: yes
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:9: other than what plays on the radio
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:9: since my cuzion likes em

Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:25: really?
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:41: my cusion listens to them alot and i hang out with him
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:43: they play all the time where i live
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:50:57: on the rock station for some reason
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:51:8: so if its not eminem or twenty one pilots or imagine dragons its gorrliz
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:51:26: and he showed me there album with rappers in it
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:51:29: so i brought it
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:52:26: all of their albums have rappers on them
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:52:50: so i like what i like
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:54:53: I respect that
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:55:53: Maybe I need to stir up a music conversation with someone a bit more open minded.
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:56:26: if i dont like most music so what
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:56:41: i started listening to other shit
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:56:53: but its good to have a man genre
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:57:13: for me thats rap and will always will be
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:57:23: that's not my point
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:58:5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dONxX9rifs
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 20:58:5: i need to have a conversation about music with someone who isn't going to hear a song and immediately go "this is weird"
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:58:20: i dont
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:58:25: i listen for a bit
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 20:58:41: but some stuff i cant get behind
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:0:16: im usually up for anything as long as it's not too poppy or fake(as in it doesn't feel genuine)
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:0:51: I absolutely can't stand most pop music
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 21:1:6: same
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:1:22: I also can't stand a lot of top selling artists because most of them sound like they were made in a factory
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:1:43: there are some exceptions
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:1:55: but there's always exceptions
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:5:46: i never said that
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:5:55: why do you always keep saying that
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:6:8: I said that it's not my favorite genre
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:6:22: there are some artists that I do like from the genre
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 21:6:33: fav rap?
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/4/2017 21:7:0: probably the band(yes they're a band) Death Grips
Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 21:7:38: nor artist ... rap

Zeus God Of All#3828 'Zeus God Of All'@ 8/4/2017 21:18:51: "Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
It's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)ï»¿" just wow man
