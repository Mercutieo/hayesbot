Marvel haven't fired any of their current writers. So its still gonna be the same unreadable tripe as its been the past couple years. Marvel Legacy is no DC Rebirth people.

Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:38:47: The only reason why I didn't have to pay a fine is because I'm a minor(so I technically don't know what I'm doing)
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:39:2: Except I knew exactly what I was doing
Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/5/2017 17:39:31: Just use a letterbox if you have to
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:39:37: I'm a lot more careful now, and I only do it on very rare occasions
Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/5/2017 17:39:39: And dont download more than like 2 gigs a month
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:39:44: well yeah

Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:40:9: 2gigs a month?
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:40:17: spider-man 3 uses 4gbs to download
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:40:17: lol
Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/5/2017 17:40:47: Like youll be fine honestly, you should buy it to support it if you can but
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:40:49: I only download albums that are like way out of print now(you can't really get caught for something that isn't commercially available anymore).
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:41:9: I buy everything else
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:41:13: youtube convertor?

Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:41:39: youtube compresses the fuck out of audio
Mer#6879 'Mer'@ 8/5/2017 17:41:46: Use soulseek for mp3
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:41:49: I prefer my MP3
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:42:26: not 128, which is what YT compresses it to
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:42:53: L.     U.     L.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:42:59: $4

Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:44:34: i guess they truly hate this game lol
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:44:40: I think $10-$15 is fine for a game(at least in the US)
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:44:54: Or they need the money(likely both though)
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:45:29: I'd sell my copy, but I have to have my collection of Spider-Man games
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:45:46: why is overpriced
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:45:52: compared to the other spidey games
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:45:56: Oof

Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 17:46:59: The most I'll pay for an older game is like $25 if it's hard to find/really good
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:47:15: I wanna one

Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:53:47: <@148175243339497473> fam
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:53:55: <@148175243339497473> let me tell u a story
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:54:34: 1 broke, 1 kinda work, two of em works on ps2,  1 works on xbox...
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:54:39: and the other two are just failed
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:54:51: the tale to get a working good copy
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:54:56: of ultimate spiderman
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:54:57: was a long one
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:15: hell even the one I have that works on ps2 barely runs and crashes all the time
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:20: <@148175243339497473> So once a upon a time, there was a little idiot called Rehxy. Back in the days, Rehxy's mum would buy him spider-man 3 for the ps2, ever since rehxy got told of this copy he immediately stratched. Fun fact stratched 7 copies including my cousins one.
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:30: .....
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:37: being dead set

TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:50: expect not straching
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:52: just not working
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 17:55:57: happened to my two copies too
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:56:4: i was stupid and i literally stratched my disc by scraping it on the floor
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:56:22: fun fact, nowadays
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:56:24: i take good care
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:56:29: i dont let anyone take out the disc
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:56:30: besides me
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:56:57: cause then i'll be like ***NO NO NO CLEAN UR HANDS NONONO U STRATCH***
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:58:31: <@148175243339497473> One time I broke my ps2
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 17:59:13: <@148175243339497473> i was like how old 5-6? I literally pushed the eject button out and stepped on it

Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:6:19: its just a gender

TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:22:45: *fun fact*
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:22:51: <@!218923764375617536> All I'm literally asking for is a gender role
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:22:52: *feminists are cannibals*
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:22:58: *they'll kill thier own for sport*
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:1: You are giving useless advice.
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:6: A gender role is useless.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:18: *suggestion*
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:21: Lets have a seperate chat depending on what your gender is.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:28: omfg
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:31: its just a role
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:34: Obviously every woman will get triggered by men
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:41: TRIGGERED
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:44: to see if u are a man or a woman
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:50: **a man or a woman**
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:51: Nobody cares.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:23:59: I'm tired of the whole "hahahahahaha guys feminists suck amirite" circlejerk. Everyone understands that any radical movement is bad news. So stop getting hung up on it.
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:24:0: **Nobody cares.**
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:24:0: ***some***

Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:24:49: A gender
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:24:57: <@!294254117746901004> Hey do you care if someone accidently calls you the opposite gender <@!153620030767104000> <@148175243339497473> <@!249882794405134336> <@!229745170097242112>
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:24:57: woman, man 

or a genderless alien
PennyWise The Serious#3828 'PennyWise The Serious'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:6: <@!218923764375617536> nope
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:16: yeah just tag everyone else, really necessary
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:23: I've been made fun of for having long hair, but I don't care really
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:31: Nope just testing who cares
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:40: Since according to you most people care
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:50: fine
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:54: ur not a man
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:56: nor a woman
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:25:59: so a genderless
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:26:0: ok
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:26:5: Since?

Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:26:39: assuming*
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:26:55: <:kms:349157191166459904>
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:26:57: Lets have a role for ex-cons
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:27:7: And seperate them by race aswell.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:27:38: <@!294254117746901004> I'm only giving a suggestion for a gender role, so people dont go off assuming
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:27:57: Nobody cares if their gender is assumed.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:27:58: what is the point though
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:14: it's just pointless to add it
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:14: People most likely wont even refer to people as he or she.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:15: .-. do i have to debate over a fucking role
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:20: They'll probably just @ them
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:31: especially when you can just ask
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:32: <:thonkin:344207678169415681>
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:42: asking isn't hard my dude
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:51: in my heart, it is
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:28:54: <@269109723406663693>: hardcore feminist.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:0: u gotta be careful of the TRIGGER
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:2: <@!218923764375617536> i get called a girl all the time so no
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:16: that and 11 years old
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:17: Looks like nobody cares.
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:21: Wah wah.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:29: <@!218923764375617536> awesome? only a suggestion
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:34: i'll go cry now
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:36: <:kms:349157191166459904>
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:29:51: If you get offended by someone assuming your gender online, I think it's time to get off. This isn't a "FEMINISTS LEAVE" kinda thing either.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:30:6: at least for me
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:30:37: ***Hello darkness my old friend.***
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:31:14: <@269109723406663693> Darkness says he doesnt like you
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:31:42: I really hate the fact that "Sounds of Silence" is a meme.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:32:21: It's a really good folk rock song, but anyone under the age of 15 uses it as the "hahaha funny depression song" meme.
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:32:45: Simon & Garfunkel are very underrated in general.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:34:17: <@148175243339497473> stop bulling yeh? its really not nice
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:34:35: btw another point to add
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:34:41: i suggest adding this gender role
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:34:42: So people dont catfish
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:35:10: you can just lie though
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:37:27: why don't we need to verify if we're male
For age
and a tag
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:37:45: **here u go mate, female role for ya**
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:38:9: nobody wants the gender role
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:38:10: because that's annoying
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:38:28: its creepy
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:38:49: if every discord server i went into had something like that, i'd probably just stick to my private server
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:39:9: ^

Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:39:55: Like, fuck off my dude.
TimTam#7021 'TimTam'@ 8/5/2017 19:39:59: <@269109723406663693> Darkness hates me too y'know
Absolve#0894 'Absolve'@ 8/5/2017 19:40:3: <@218923764375617536> Somebody calling me by the wrong gender? Nah, I'm used to it because all the way through 6 to 10 years old my friends parents would at first believe they were talking to a little girl
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:40:20: Ooo
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:40:22: Look

Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:40:40: I think we should move on from this
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:40:51: it's obvious how one sided this has become
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:41:1: a role
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:41:5: that has genders

SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:41:18: A creepy role
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:41:24: oh yeah u dont mind me
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:41:24: why would you add something that has no purpose
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:41:27: ^

SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:43:4: Because I don't want it to be added
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:43:12: <@269109723406663693> Most people here seem to be human, which means that assuming the wrong gender won't hur their feelings much.
Rehxy#2170 'Rehxy'@ 8/5/2017 19:43:15: **at first it was a suggestion**
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:43:17: Oh yeah that fucking was real neccasary. Good edit.

Absolve#0894 'Absolve'@ 8/5/2017 19:46:44: Honestly, I don't believe a gender role is necessary, if someone calls you by the wrong gender you can respectively correct them
Schpida-Man#6256 'Schpida-Man'@ 8/5/2017 19:46:54: I'm not hating you. Why are you getting upset?
SpiderMatt#0458 'SpiderMatt'@ 8/5/2017 19:46:58: No actually you need to cry in a ditch.
